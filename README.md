# Candy Mint Clicker

I have written a simple and uncomplicated clicker game to enjoy over the weekend. 
The goal of the game is straightforward - click on the candies to earn rewards.

## Future plans

There is a desire to implement a system of lives.

P.S.
In fact, there are many lessons and tasks at the university, so I can't fully invest in the game.

But the project is not closed!
